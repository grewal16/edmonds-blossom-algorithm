## Technology Stack & Architecture
This project is built primarily using **C++**, leveraging standard library features for graph representation and algorithmic logic. The architecture is straightforward: a single C++ source file (`graph.cpp`) contains the entire implementation, focusing on clarity and algorithmic correctness. The core components revolve around graph data structures, Breadth-First Search (BFS) for path finding, and the unique blossom detection and contraction/expansion mechanisms central to Edmonds' algorithm.
