## üìä Architecture & Database Schema
The project's architecture is a direct, single-module implementation of the Edmonds Blossom algorithm. The core logic handles graph input, processes paths, contracts and expands "blossoms" to find augmenting paths, and ultimately determines the maximum matching.

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Deployment
No complex configuration or deployment steps are required. The project is a standalone C++ source file. Compilation typically involves a standard C++ compiler, and execution is direct.

## ‚ö° Quick Start Guide
To get this powerful algorithm running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/edmonds-blossom-algorithm.git
    cd edmonds-blossom-algorithm
    ```
2.  **Compile the source code:**
    ```bash
    g++ graph.cpp -o edmonds_blossom -std=c++11 -O2
    ```
    (Ensure you have a C++ compiler like `g++` installed.)
3.  **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    ./edmonds_blossom
    ```
    (The program will likely expect graph input via `stdin` or a file, as is common for algorithm implementations.)
