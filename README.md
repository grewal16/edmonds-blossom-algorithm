*   **Build System:** Standard C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC/G++)

## üìä Architecture & Database Schema
The Edmonds Blossom Algorithm follows a sophisticated flow involving augmenting paths and blossom shrinking/expansion. Here's a high-level representation of its operational architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Input Graph (Vertices & Edges)"] --> B["Initialize Matching M (Empty)"];
    B --> C{"Search for Augmenting Path P"};
    C -- Path Found --> D["Augment M with P"];
    C -- No Path --> E["Maximum Matching M Found"];
    D --> C;
    C -- Blossom Detected --> F["Shrink Blossom into Supervertex"];
    F --> C;
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Deployment
This project is a self-contained C++ application. No complex configurations, external databases, or third-party frameworks are required beyond a standard C++ compiler and the source code itself.

## ‚ö° Quick Start Guide
To compile and run this powerful algorithm on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/edmonds-blossom-algorithm.git
    cd edmonds-blossom-algorithm
    ```
2.  **Compile the Source Code:**
    ```bash
    g++ -o edmonds_blossom graph.cpp -std=c++11 -Wall
    ```
    *(Using `-std=c++11` ensures compatibility, and `-Wall` enables all warnings for robust compilation.)*
3.  **Run the Executable:**
    ```bash
    ./edmonds_blossom
    ```
    *(The program will then execute the algorithm, likely on an internally defined or read graph, and potentially output results or demonstrate the process.)*
