## âš¡ Quick Start Guide
To get this powerful algorithm running on your machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/edmonds-blossom-algorithm.git
    cd edmonds-blossom-algorithm
    ```
2.  **Compile the C++ Code:**
    ```bash
    g++ graph.cpp -o graph
    ```
3.  **Run the Executable:**
    ```bash
    ./graph
    ```
    The program will likely prompt for graph input or process pre-defined structures. Refer to the `Report_Implementation_of_Edmonds_Blossom_Algorithm.pdf` for specific input formats and detailed usage.
