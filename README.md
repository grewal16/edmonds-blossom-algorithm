## üìä Architecture & Database Schema
The Edmonds Blossom Algorithm is a sophisticated graph algorithm. Below is a high-level flowchart illustrating its core operational flow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Input Graph (G)"] --> B{"Initialize Matching & BFS"};
    B -- "Find Augmenting Path" --> C{"Path Found?"};
    C -- "No" --> D["Output Maximum Matching"];
    C -- "Yes" --> E{"Blossom Found?"};
    E -- "Yes" --> F["Shrink Blossom"];
    E -- "No" --> G["Augment Path"];
    F --> B;
    G --> H["Unshrink Blossoms"];
    H --> B;
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Deployment
This project is a standalone C++ application. It requires a standard C++ compiler (like g++ or Clang) to compile and execute. There are no complex configuration files or external dependencies beyond a basic C++ development environment.
