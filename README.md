# ðŸš€ Edmonds Blossom Algorithm Implementation

This repository presents a robust and efficient C++ implementation of the **Edmonds Blossom Algorithm**, a foundational algorithm in graph theory for finding maximum cardinality matchings in general graphs. Unlike simpler matching algorithms that only work on bipartite graphs, the Edmonds Blossom Algorithm conquers the complexity of arbitrary graphs, including those with odd cycles (blossoms), making it an indispensable tool for advanced graph problems.

## ðŸ“Š Architecture & Database Schema
This project is an algorithmic implementation rather than a database-driven application. Therefore, an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is not applicable. Instead, we visualize the high-level operational flow of the Edmonds Blossom Algorithm as implemented.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Start: Define Graph (Vertices & Edges)"] --> B{"Current Matching Maximal?"};
    B -- "No" --> C["Find Augmenting Path"];
    C --> D{"Blossom Detected?"};
    D -- "Yes" --> E["Contract Blossom"];
    E --> C;
    D -- "No" --> F["Augment Matching"];
    F --> G["Update Matching"];
    G --> B;
    B -- "Yes" --> H["End: Maximum Matching Found"];
```
This flowchart illustrates the iterative process: the algorithm continuously searches for augmenting paths. If an odd cycle (blossom) is encountered, it's contracted to simplify the graph, and the search continues. Once an augmenting path is found, the matching is updated, and the process repeats until no more augmenting paths can be found, signifying a maximum matching.

## âš¡ Quick Start Guide
To get this powerful algorithm running on your machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/edmonds-blossom-algorithm.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd edmonds-blossom-algorithm
    ```
3.  **Compile the C++ Code:**
    ```bash
    g++ graph.cpp -o edmonds_blossom
    ```
4.  **Run the Executable:**
    ```bash
    ./edmonds_blossom
    ```
    The program will then await graph input, typically provided through standard input in a format like: first line `N M` (number of vertices, number of edges), followed by `M` lines each containing `u v` for an edge between vertex `u` and `v`.
