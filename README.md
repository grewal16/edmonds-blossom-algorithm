## âš¡ Quick Start Guide
To get this powerful algorithm running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/edmonds-blossom-algorithm.git
    cd edmonds-blossom-algorithm
    ```
2.  **Compile the Source Code:**
    Ensure you have a C++ compiler (like g++) installed on your system.
    ```bash
    g++ -std=c++11 -o graph graph.cpp
    ```
3.  **Run the Algorithm:**
    The compiled executable (`graph`) typically takes graph input from `stdin` or a file. For the expected input format, please refer to the `Inputs.gif` animation or the detailed `Report_Implementation_of_Edmonds_Blossom_Algorithm.pdf`.
    ```bash
    ./graph < input_graph.txt
    ```
    (Replace `input_graph.txt` with the path to your graph data file.)
