## Technology Stack & Architecture
This project is a pure, high-performance C++ implementation, focusing on algorithmic efficiency and clarity. It leverages standard C++ features and data structures to build a self-contained and effective solution without external dependencies or complex frameworks.

## ðŸ“Š Architecture & Database Schema
The core of this project is the **Edmonds Blossom Algorithm** itself, which iteratively refines a matching by finding augmenting paths. The process involves sophisticated graph traversal (BFS), cycle detection, and dynamic graph transformation (blossom shrinking and expansion). Here's a high-level overview of its operational flow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start Algorithm] --> B(Initialize Empty Matching M);
    B --> C{Find Augmenting Path P using BFS?};
    C -- "Yes" --> D{Odd Cycle ("Blossom") detected during BFS?};
    D -- "Yes" --> E[Shrink Blossom to Pseudo-Node];
    E --> C;
    D -- "No" --> F[Augment Matching M with P];
    F --> C;
    C -- "No" --> G(Return Maximum Matching M);
    G --> H[End Algorithm];
```

## âš¡ Quick Start Guide
To get this powerful algorithm up and running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/edmonds-blossom-algorithm.git
    cd edmonds-blossom-algorithm
    ```
2.  **Compile the C++ Code:**
    Ensure you have a C++ compiler (like g++).
    ```bash
    g++ graph.cpp -o edmonds_blossom
    ```
3.  **Run the Executable:**
    The program will likely expect graph input. Refer to `Inputs.gif` or the `Report_Implementation_of_Edmonds_Blossom_Algorithm.pdf` for expected input formats.
    ```bash
    ./edmonds_blossom
    # ... then provide graph input as per the program's requirements
    ```
