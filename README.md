## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Deployment
This project is a standalone C++ application. It requires a standard C++ compiler (such as GCC or Clang) to build the executable from the source code. No external libraries or complex configurations are needed beyond the compiler.

## ‚ö° Quick Start Guide
To get the Edmonds Blossom Algorithm running on your machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grewal16/edmonds-blossom-algorithm.git
    cd edmonds-blossom-algorithm
    ```

2.  **Compile the Source Code:**
    Use a C++ compiler to build the `graph.cpp` file into an executable.
    ```bash
    g++ graph.cpp -o edmonds_blossom
    ```

3.  **Run the Executable:**
    Execute the compiled program. It will process graph data (likely from standard input or a predefined structure within the code) and output the maximum matching.
    ```bash
    ./edmonds_blossom
    ```
